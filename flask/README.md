# Welcome to your organization's demo respository
This code repository (or "repo") is designed to demonstrate the best GitHub has to offer with the least amount of noise.

The repo includes an `index.html` file (so it can render a web page), two GitHub Actions workflows, and a CSS stylesheet dependency.

以上为初始界面生成的html，本开源项目支持python等语言进行项目更新，项目如下：flask页面（注册系统和登录系统等）、算法（参照中文版第三版算法导论）等项目
The above is the HTML generated from the initial interface. This open source project supports Python and other languages for project updates. The projects include Flask page (registration system and login system, etc.), algorithm (refer to the Chinese version of Algorithm Introduction, 3rd edition), and other projects
